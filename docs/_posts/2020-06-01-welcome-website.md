Welcome to the independent government open data portal for the town of Arlington, MA!  We're just getting started, please see our [Project Roadmap for future plans](https://github.com/ArlingtonMA/arligntonma.info/wiki/Project-Roadmap).

This website is not managed by town government in Arlington, MA; it is run by volunteers.  We hope to collaborate with the town directly where possible, much like the [Arlington Visual Budget project](http://arlingtonvisualbudget.org/) did.
