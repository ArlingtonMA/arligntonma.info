Welcome to the independent open data website for the town of Arlington, MA!  We're just getting started, please see our [Project Roadmap for future plans](https://github.com/ArlingtonMA/arligntonma.info/wiki/Project-Roadmap).  Our goal is transparency in town government, and we help residents better understand what's happening by surfacing and visualizing important data about how our town works.

This website is not managed by [town government in Arlington, MA](https://arlingtonma.gov/); it is run by volunteers.  We hope to collaborate with the town directly where possible, much like the [Arlington Visual Budget project](http://arlingtonvisualbudget.org/) did.
