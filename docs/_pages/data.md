This site hosts or organizes open data pointers to a variety of statistics and other factual information and reports about Arlington, MA and some nearby comparable towns.  A brief selection of data available currently:

- [Annual Reports for Arlington](/governance/) and comparable communities.
- [Budgets for Arlington](/finance/) (including historical) and recent year budgets for comparable communities.
- Some [prototype visualizations of policing budgets and staffing](/test/).


## Future Plans / Ideas

- High-level finances/expenses, compared to comparable municipalities; especially %ages of budget expense per town department (compare schools, police, dpw, debt, etc).  [Data already uploaded as CSV](/data/finance/GenFundExpenditures2019-comps.csv) and [sample metadata](/data/finance/GenFundExpenditures2019-comps.json) (roughly based on mass.gov).
- Police budgets per category - salaries, training, equipment, etc.  Topical subject.
- Police calls by month, past year, categorized; comparative to past years; Comparative to comparable municipalities.  Categorize types of crime vs. non-crime calls.
- Key Schools progress reports - either MCAS or other achievement data change over time.
