title: Financial Data For Arlington And Comparable Towns
classes: wide
---

Arlington and comparable towns/cities in Massachusetts each create somewhat similar annual budgets and other financial reports.  We provide direct pointers to various town's budgets (at least the current FY) as well as some selected annotations.  

Separately, all municipalities in Massachusetts report high-level financial budgets and expenses to the state.  The [MA Division of Local Services](https://www.mass.gov/orgs/division-of-local-services) (DLS) collects and provides [high-level budget figures](https://dlsgateway.dor.state.ma.us/reports/rdPage.aspx?rdReport=ScheduleA.GenFund_MAIN) which are valuable for a general way to compare different town budgets.  However different towns may reports certain expenses subtly differently in the high-level DLS report categories, so please be careful when making comparisons.  For example, in the [DLS Expenditures categories](https://dlsgateway.dor.state.ma.us/reports/rdPage.aspx?rdReport=ScheduleA.GenFund_MAIN), some towns may report school crossing guard salary expenses under _Police_, while other towns may report it under _Education_.  So numbers reported in DLS reports are not necessarily directly comparable against individual municipality specific budgets by category, although they do tend to be close.
