Welcome to ArlingtonMA.info, an independent data portal surfacing publicly available data about the town of Arlington, MA.

We're just getting started, please see our [Project Roadmap for future plans](https://github.com/ArlingtonMA/arligntonma.info/wiki/Project-Roadmap).

This website is not affiliated with town government in Arlington, MA, and is run by volunteers.  We are collaborating with the town to obtain relevant data sets and increase the accessibility of information about local government to facilitate greater citizen engagement.

All data is drawn directly from reliable government or other sources, and same-named .json files with dcat:Dataset metadata is provided for every source, allowing integration with other data portals or visualization tools.
