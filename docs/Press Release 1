Arlington Info has launched an open data portal for the Town of Arlington, at Arlington.info. Arlington Info will become a convenient source of trusted financial, demographic and statistical data about Arlington, all from cited reliable sources and without any bias or agenda. As needed, the same data may be collected from peer communities for comparison. Priority will be given to data which is relevant to current issues and upcoming decisions. Datasets will be made available through an API for additional analysis by others.

Menotomy Matters is operated by a team of volunteers with experience in data science and local governance, who collect data from the Town, State and other reliable sources, normalize them into datasets, provide access through an API, and in many cases provide interactive visualizations.
